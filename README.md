Pip All

Okay, so upgrading packages en masse isn't really a "pip thing". All you can do
is ask pip "hey, what are my outdated packages?" and pip will tell you. If you
then ask pip "please, sir, I want some updates" I mean "update all the
packages" pip responds with ~~"What!"~~ "lol, no".

![Please, sir, I want some updated pip packges](.binary-assets/Oliver-Twist-begging.jpeg)

Enter `pip-all`. It fills in the void in our hearts, and our bowls.

It's also written in ~~perl~~ python. What else would you expect?
